# Sedation State Prediction using EEG Graph-Theoretical Features

Machine-learning pipeline for predicting sedation states (responsiveness in earlier versions) during propofol sedation based on EEG-derived graph-theoretical measures (e.g., small-worldness, clustering, mean degree).

## Overview

This project explores how network topology metrics extracted from EEG connectivity (dwPLI) relate to consciousness under propofol sedation. By leveraging graph-theoretical measures, we train machine-learning models to infer sedation states beyond descriptive analysis.
